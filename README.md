# Algorithms to Practise 
# Problems

Collection of problems and solutions of [algoExpert](https://algoExpert.com/), [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) challenges I solved while preparing for my Google interview.

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that this is a small part of the entire journey. It does not contain:

- Study materials. You and the interviewer should have a common language for communication. This means that you'd have to have a good understanding of the fundamental computer science terminology.
- Thought process. During the interview, you should explain your thought process and approach the problems in a certain way. To understand this part, I'd recommend you looking at "[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)".
- Some of the solutions in the repo might not be the most optimal ones. Feel free to open a PR with an alternative version.
